#Chordy

This is a tiny app which lets you pick some chords and get them back in a random order to help with chord transitions.

This version is totally unstyled and still missing some enhancements, but it works for now

##TODO

-	Fix some timing issues
-	Style the damn thing
-	~~Stop the same chord being shown twice in a row~~
-	~~Put a check on the homepage to ensure more than one chord is selected~~
-	Add in chord groups that actually make sense
-	Add in the rest of the chord diagrams.

If you have any suggestions, let me know.
